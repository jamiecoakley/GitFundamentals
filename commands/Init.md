# git init

The `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository.

_( `  <-This type of quotes around a word made that text the way it is. The type of quote three times in a row around a block of text makes the black box.)_

If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[status](./Status.md), 
[add](./Add.md), 
[commit](./Commit.md), 
[push](./Push.md), 
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
